Ola App Landing Page Redesign

Project Overview

This project focuses on redesigning the landing page of the Ola app to create a more user-friendly & visually appealing interface. The redesign reduces decision fatigue for users and aligns the UI with modern design standards while maintaining a clear focus on functionality.

Inspiration and Discovery

Analyzing competitor apps like Uber and Rapido, the current Ola app landing page was found to be cluttered and overwhelming, with too many elements vying for attention. This inspired a minimalist redesign that streamlines navigation and prioritizes key features.
